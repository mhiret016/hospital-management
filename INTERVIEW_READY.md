## Your Story: "Walk Me Through Your Project"

### 2-Minute Version

"I built a full-stack hospital management system to demonstrate enterprise Java development skills.

**Architecture**: I used a three-tier architecture - React frontend, Spring Boot backend, and MySQL database. The backend follows a layered pattern with Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Entities.

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- **Spring Boot** for dependency injection and auto-configuration
- **JWT** for stateless authentication
- **DTOs** to decouple API from database structure
- **React Query** for efficient server state management
- **TypeScript** for type safety

**Challenges Solved**:
- Implemented secure JWT authentication with token validation
- Prevented N+1 queries using JPA fetch joins
- Managed environment variables properly
- Built responsive UI with Material-UI

**What I'd Improve**:
- Add comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Implement API documentation with Swagger
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Implement audit logging

The project demonstrates I can build production-quality applications using modern best practices."

## Key Concepts You MUST Know

### 1. The Flow (Can You Explain This?)

```
USER ACTION
    ‚Üì
Frontend Validation (Formik + Yup)
    ‚Üì
HTTP Request (Axios with JWT token)
    ‚Üì
Backend Security Filter (Validates JWT)
    ‚Üì
Controller (Receives request, validates with @Valid)
    ‚Üì
Service (Business logic, DTO ‚Üî Entity conversion)
    ‚Üì
Repository (Spring Data JPA)
    ‚Üì
Database (MySQL with SQL)
    ‚Üì
[Response flows back up the chain]
    ‚Üì
Frontend Updates (React Query invalidates cache)
    ‚Üì
UI Re-renders
```

**Practice**: Explain this flow for "Create New Patient" out loud.

---

### 2. Why Each Layer? (Be Ready to Explain)

**Controller**:
- HTTP concerns only
- Request/Response handling
- Status codes
- *Not* business logic

**Service**:
- Business logic
- Transaction management (@Transactional)
- DTO ‚Üî Entity conversion
- Orchestrates multiple repositories

**Repository**:
- Database operations
- CRUD methods
- Custom queries
- Spring Data JPA magic

**Why separate?**
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Testability (mock each layer)
- Maintainability (change one without affecting others)

---

### 3. DTO vs Entity (Critical to Understand)

**Entity** (Patient.java):
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "patient")
public class Patient {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne  // Database relationship
    private Doctor primaryDoctor;

    @ElementCollection  // Separate table
    private List<String> allergies;
}
```
- Maps to database
- Has JPA annotations
- Never sent to frontend

**DTO** (PatientInformation):
```java
public record PatientInformation(
    Long id,
    String firstName,
    DoctorInformation primaryDoctor,  // Controlled nesting
    List<String> allergies
) {}
```
- Clean data contract
- No JPA annotations
- Sent to/from frontend

**Why?**
- Prevents circular references
- Hides database structure
- API stability (can change DB without breaking API)

---

### 4. JWT Flow (Must Know Cold)

1. **Login**:
   ```
   User sends credentials
   ‚Üí Backend validates (BCrypt)
   ‚Üí Generate JWT (sign with secret)
   ‚Üí Return token to client
   ```

2. **Subsequent Requests**:
   ```
   Frontend includes: Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ‚Üí JwtFilter extracts token
   ‚Üí Validates signature (using same secret)
   ‚Üí Checks expiration
   ‚Üí Sets SecurityContext
   ‚Üí Request proceeds
   ```

3. **What's In The Token?**
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "admin@eva-hospital.com",
     "iat": 1234567890,
     "exp": 1234571490
   }
   ```

**Why JWT?**
- Stateless (no server sessions)
- Scalable (works across multiple servers)
- Self-contained (includes user info)

---

### 5. React Query (Why It's Awesome)

```typescript
// Without React Query
const [patients, setPatients] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
    setLoading(true);
    fetch('/api/patient')
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(data => {
            setPatients(data);
            setLoading(false);
        })
        .catch(err => {
            setError(err);
            setLoading(false);
        });
}, []);

// WITH React Query
const { data: patients, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['patients'],
    queryFn: getAllPatients,
});
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic caching
- Background refetching
- Loading/error states built-in
- Cache invalidation on mutations
- Less boilerplate

## Common Interview Questions - Quick Answers

### "What's dependency injection?"

"Spring manages object creation and wiring. Instead of `new PatientService()`, Spring injects it:

```java
@RestController
public class PatientController {
    private final PatientService service;  // Spring injects this

    @Autowired  // or use @RequiredArgsConstructor with Lombok
    public PatientController(PatientService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }
}
```

**Benefits**: Easier testing (inject mocks), loose coupling, no new keyword."

---

### "How do you prevent SQL injection?"

"I use JPA parameterized queries:

```java
// SAFE - JPA uses prepared statements
@Query("SELECT p FROM Patient p WHERE p.firstName = :name")
Patient findByName(@Param("name") String name);
```

Input is treated as DATA, not CODE. Plus Bean Validation prevents malicious input."

---

### "Why TypeScript?"

"Type safety catches bugs at compile time:

```typescript
// JavaScript - runtime error
const patient = { name: "John" };
console.log(patient.firstName);  // undefined - bug!

// TypeScript - compile error
interface Patient {
    firstName: string;
}
const patient: Patient = { name: "John" };  // ERROR!
```

Also provides better IDE autocomplete and refactoring."

---

### "What's @Transactional?"

"Ensures atomicity - all database operations succeed or all roll back:

```java
@Transactional
public void createPatient(...) {
    Patient patient = repository.save(newPatient);  // 1
    Doctor doctor = doctorRepository.findById(id);  // 2
    doctor.addPatient(patient);                     // 3
    doctorRepository.save(doctor);                  // 4
}
```

If step 4 fails, steps 1-3 roll back. Database stays consistent."

---

### "How would you add a new feature?"

"Example: Add patient's emergency contact

**Backend**:
1. Add field to Patient entity
2. Update DTOs (PostNewPatientRequest, PatientInformation)
3. Update service to handle new field
4. Migration script for database

**Frontend**:
1. Add field to TypeScript interface
2. Add to form (Formik)
3. Add Yup validation
4. Display in patient details

**Test**:
1. Unit test service method
2. Integration test API endpoint
3. Manual test in UI

Following layered architecture means changes are isolated and predictable."
