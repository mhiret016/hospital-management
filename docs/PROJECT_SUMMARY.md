## Key Features You Built

### 1. **Layered Architecture**
- Clean separation between layers
- Each layer has single responsibility
- Easy to test and maintain

### 2. **DTO Pattern**
- API uses DTOs (PatientInformation, DoctorInformation)
- Internal code uses Entities (Patient, Doctor)
- Prevents tight coupling

### 3. **JWT Authentication**
- Stateless (no sessions)
- Secure password hashing (BCrypt)
- Token-based authorization

### 4. **React Query**
- Automatic caching
- Background refetching
- Optimistic updates

### 5. **Type Safety**
- TypeScript on frontend
- Java type system on backend
- Validation at every layer

## What Makes This Production-Quality?

✅ **Security**:
- Environment variables for secrets
- JWT authentication
- Password hashing
- Input validation
- CORS configuration

✅ **Best Practices**:
- Layered architecture
- DTO pattern
- Exception handling
- Logging (SQL queries)
- Docker containerization

✅ **Modern Stack**:
- Latest Spring Boot (3.5.6)
- React 18 with hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Material-UI for professional UI

## Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about your project"

"I built a full-stack hospital management system using Spring Boot and React. It demonstrates enterprise patterns like layered architecture, JWT authentication, and the DTO pattern. The backend uses Spring Security for auth, Spring Data JPA for database operations, and follows REST principles. The frontend uses React Query for state management, TypeScript for type safety, and Material-UI for a professional medical interface."

### "What challenges did you face?"

"One challenge was implementing JWT authentication correctly - ensuring tokens are validated on every request, handling expiration, and storing them securely on the frontend. Another was preventing N+1 queries in JPA by using fetch joins and understanding when to use DTOs vs entities."

### "What would you improve?"

"I'd add comprehensive testing, implement pagination for large datasets, add API documentation with Swagger, implement audit logging for regulatory compliance, and add soft deletes instead of hard deletes to preserve data history."

---

## Key Code Examples to Remember

### JWT Filter
```java
@Override
protected void doFilterInternal(...) {
    String token = extractToken(request);
    if (jwtService.isTokenValid(token)) {
        SecurityContextHolder
            .getContext()
            .setAuthentication(authToken);
    }
}
```

### Service Layer Pattern
```java
@Service
@Transactional
public class PatientService {
    public PatientInformation createPatient(PostNewPatientRequest dto) {
        Patient entity = convertToEntity(dto);  // DTO → Entity
        Patient saved = repository.save(entity);
        return convertToDTO(saved);  // Entity → DTO
    }
}
```

### React Query Mutation
```typescript
const mutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: (data) => axios.post('/api/patient', data),
    onSuccess: () => {
        queryClient.invalidateQueries(['patients']);
    }
});
```

## Resume Bullet Points

```
• Built full-stack hospital management system using Spring Boot 3.5.6,
  React 18, TypeScript, and MySQL, demonstrating enterprise-level
  architecture with 15+ REST endpoints

• Implemented JWT-based authentication with Spring Security, including
  token validation, password hashing (BCrypt), and role-based access control

• Designed layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository → Entity)
  with DTO pattern to decouple API contracts from database entities

• Utilized React Query for efficient server state management, automatic
  caching, and optimistic updates, improving user experience

• Containerized application with Docker Compose, enabling consistent
  development environments and simplified deployment

• Applied form validation using Formik + Yup (frontend) and Bean Validation
  (backend) to ensure data integrity at multiple layers
